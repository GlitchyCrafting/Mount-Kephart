    <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
    <p><strong>We use a cookie to track your lesson.</strong> This allows us to redirect you to your current lesson automagically without using as many resources as an account system, although I do plan on switching to accounts in the far-ahead.</p>

    <h2>The Platform</h2>
    <p>I created the platform to have the verbosity of W3Schools in the lessons, but in the format of FreeCodeCamp. The UI is built to be minimal using readable fonts, no more "Is this an l, or an I?", and a color scheme that's easy on the eyes. It has an online editor so nothing needs to be installed on the user's computer. It also has a live preview to allow for visualization of what code does what. No account creation is needed as everything is stored in a single cookie.</p>

    <h2>Backend</h2>
    <p>The server is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> and all dependencies can be found in <a href="https://github.com/GlitchyCrafting/Mount-Kephart/blob/main/Cargo.toml">Cargo.toml</a>. The online editor is the <a href="https://ace.c9.io">Ace Library</a> written in Javascript. The UI uses the <a href="https://draculatheme.com">Dracula Color Scheme</a>. There is a live preview that uses Javascript Blobs to get code from the editor and display it in an IFrame. By using the Rust language, it is fully cross-platform to Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p>
